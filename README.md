# UoL-Trash-and-Treasure

“Trash & Treasure” is a 2D action-puzzle game. You organise waste, recycling, and valuables as quickly as possible, with an ever-growing backlog. Controlling an adorable garbage robot, you manage a busy sorting facility. Items scroll across the screen and players must quickly and accurately sort them into the correct bins by launching them. Unsorted items degrade and clog up the screen.

## Suno (Generative Audio)

I used Suno to generate the foundation for a background music track. The course permits generative tools for non-coding solutions, like art and music. I purchased a premium subscription to own the licence and the ability to extract stems from the audio. 

After generating the track, I imported it into REAPER where I heavily updated the audio file by rearranging sections, cleaning up artifacts, and improving the piece. 

Next, using FMOD, I processed the track, creating loop regions, transitions, and implementing EQ and reverb effects. Finally, I added FMOD parameters and exposed them to Unity, allowing the game code to influence the audio based on gameplay states.
